      <span class="wiki">From Wikipedia, </span>the free encyclopedia  For the chamber ensemble, see
      Fibonacci Sequence (ensemble). A tiling with squares whose side lengths
      are successive Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21 In
      mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is
      the sum of the two preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci
      sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š. The
      sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the
      sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.
      Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
      34, 55, 89, 144, ....[1] The Fibonacci numbers were first described in
      Indian mathematics as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating
      possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two
      lengths.[2][3][4] They are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo
      of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, who introduced the sequence to Western
      European mathematics in his 1202 book Liber Abaci.[5] Fibonacci numbers
      appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an
      entire journal dedicated to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly.
      Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the
      Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and
      graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and
      distributed systems. They also appear in biological settings, such as
      branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts
      of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, and the arrangement of a
      pine cone's bracts, though they do not occur in all species.
